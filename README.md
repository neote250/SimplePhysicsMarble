# SimplePhysicsMarble

A quick and fun physics-based marble game built with the Godot Engine. Watch marbles bounce through obstacles using realistic 2D physics simulation.
Obviously this was done with limited time so it only has limited features. Could expand on this to make it a real game, but for now it is just an example.

## üéÆ Game Overview

SimplePhysicsMarble is a physics demonstration game where players bounce marbles in a physics playground. The marbles interact with various obstacles and surfaces using Godot's built-in physics engine, creating an engaging and satisfying gameplay experience.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Realistic Physics**: Utilizes Godot's Box2D physics engine for accurate marble movement and collisions
- **Dynamic Obstacles**: Various walls and holes for marbles to interact with
- **Bounce & Collision Effects**: Realistic bounce, friction, and collision responses
- **Lightweight & Fast**: Optimized for smooth performance across different devices

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
